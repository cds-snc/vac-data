       "Veterans Hiring Act (Priority Hire)                  10                  The Veterans Hiring Act creates a new statutory priority entitlement for Veterans whose medical release is attributable to service. Veterans will be eligible for this new statutory priority entitlement for up to five years and will be considered by hiring managers before all other candidates for public service jobs. In order for you to be eligible for the new statutory priority entitlement, the Department needs to determine whether your medical release was attributable to service or not. If  VAC decides that your medical release was attributable to service, you will be eligible for the new statutory top ranking priority entitlement. If you would like VAC to provide you with this determination, you should complete the Medical Release Attributable to Service Determination form. This form will allow VAC to obtain your service health information from the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) or Library and Archives Canada, if it is needed to make the determination.   \n",
